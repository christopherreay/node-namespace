# THREADS (primary)

High-level index of primary threads. Each thread points to a `threads/THR-*.md` detail file.

Related protocol:
- `ops/THREADS-PROTOCOL.md` (decision capture + n-dimensional axes guidance)

Index rule:
- Keep this file minimal: id, title, 1-sentence summary, pointer to detail file.

## Primary threads
